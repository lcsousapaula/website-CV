AB  - The Rhipicephalus sanguineus group is an assembly of species morphologically and 
      phylogenetically related to Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu stricto. The taxonomy 
      and systematics of this species group have remained obscure for a long time, but 
      extensive research conducted during the past two decades has closed many 
      knowledge gaps. These research advancements culminated in the redescription of R. 
      sanguineus sensu stricto, with subsequent revalidation of former synonyms 
      (Rhipicephalus linnaei, Rhipicephalus rutilus, and Rhipicephalus secundus) and 
      even the description of new species (Rhipicephalus afranicus and Rhipicephalus 
      hibericus). With a much clearer picture of the taxonomy of these species, we 
      present an updated list of species belonging to the R. sanguineus group, along 
      with a review of their geographic distribution and vector role for various 
      pathogens of animals and humans. We also identify knowledge gaps to be bridged in 
      future studies.

TI  - Ixochymostatin, a trypsin inhibitor-like (TIL) protein from Ixodes scapularis, 
      inhibits chymase and impairs vascular permeability.

AB  - Ticks obtain a blood meal by lacerating small blood vessels and ingesting the 
      blood that flows to the feeding site, which triggers various host responses. 
      However, ticks face the challenge of wound healing, a process involving 
      hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation and migration, and remodeling, 
      hindering blood acquisition. To overcome these obstacles, tick salivary glands 
      produce an array of bioactive molecules. Here, we characterize ixochymostatin, an 
      Ixodes scapularis protein belonging to the trypsin inhibitor-like (TIL) family. 
      It is expressed in multiple developmental stages and in tick salivary glands and 
      acts as a slow and tight-binding inhibitor of chymase, cathepsin G, and 
      chymotrypsin. Predictions for the tertiary structure complex between 
      ixochymostatin and chymase suggest a direct interaction between the inhibitor 
      reactive site loop and protease active sites. In vitro, ixochymostatin protects 
      the endothelial cell barrier against chymase degrading action, decreasing cell 
      permeability. In vivo, it reduces vascular permeability induced by chymase and 
      compound 48/80, a mast cell degranulator agonist, in a mouse model. Additionally, 
      ixochymostatin inhibits the chymase-dependent generation of vasoconstrictor 
      peptides. Antibodies against ixochymostatin neutralize its inhibitory properties, 
      with epitope mapping identifying potential neutralization regions. Ixochymostatin 
      emerges as a novel tick protein modulating host responses against tick feeding, 
      facilitating blood acquisition.

TI  - Exploring the longitudinal expression dynamics of midguts in adult female 
      Amblyomma americanum ticks.
PG  - 996

AB  - BACKGROUND: Female ticks remain attached to their host for multiple days to 
      complete a blood meal. This prolonged feeding period is accompanied by a 
      significant increase in the tick's size and body weight, paralleled by noteworthy 
      changes to the tick midgut. While the midgut is recognized for its established 
      role in blood storage and processing, its importance extends to playing a crucial 
      role in the acquisition, survival, and proliferation of pathogens. Despite this, 
      our overall understanding of tick midgut biology is limited. RESULTS: Our 
      transcriptome analysis identified 15,599 putative DNA coding sequences (CDS), 
      which were classified into 26 functional groups. Dimensional and differential 
      expression analyses revealed four primary transcriptional profiles corresponding 
      to unfed, slow-feeding, transitory (from slow- to rapid-feeding), and 
      rapid-feeding stages. Additionally, comparing the current dataset with previously 
      deposited transcriptome from other tick species allowed the identification of 
      commonly expressed transcripts across different feeding stages. CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings provide a detailed temporal resolution of numerous metabolic pathways in 
      the midgut of A. americanum adult females throughout the feeding process, 
      highlighting the dynamic transcriptional regulation of the tick's midgut as 
      feeding progresses. Furthermore, we identified conserved transcripts across three 
      different tick species that exhibit similar expression patterns. This knowledge 
      not only enhances our understanding of the physiological processes within the 
      tick midgut but also opens up potential avenues for developing control methods 
      that target multiple tick species.

      in the tick midgut as feeding progresses, particularly during the initial period 
      of feeding and the transition from the slow-feeding to the rapid-feeding phase. 
      Additionally, we performed an orthology analysis comparing our dataset with 
      midgut transcriptomes from other hard ticks, such as Ixodes scapularis and 
      Rhipicephalus microplus. This comparison allowed us to identify transcripts 
      commonly expressed during different feeding phases across these three species.

AB  - Leishmaniases are a group of neglected diseases of significant public health 
      concern, with Brazil being the primary focus of this disease in the Americas. The 
      municipality of Sobral, in the state of Ceará, is a historical focus of visceral 
      leishmaniasis in both humans and dogs, but data on Leishmania spp. infections in 
      cats are limited. Between April 2021 and February 2022, 205 cats from a referral 
      hospital population were sampled and tested for Leishmania spp. by real-time PCR. 
      Eight cats (3.9%; 95% CI: 1.7-7.5%) tested positive. Among these, three (37.5%) 
      displayed clinical signs compatible with feline leishmaniosis. Non-domiciled cats 
      showed significantly higher positivity compared to domiciled ones (Fisher's exact 
      test, P = 0.0124). Considering their potential role as reservoirs of L. infantum, 
      it is crucial to conduct further studies to understand the Leishmania spp. 
      circulating among cats in Sobral and to implement measures for reducing their 
      exposure to phlebotomine sand fly vectors in this important focus of 
      leishmaniases.

AB  - Blood-feeding behavior has independently evolved in arthropods multiple times. 
      Unlike hard ticks, soft ticks employ a rapid-feeding strategy for hematophagy, 
      and there are comparatively limited studies on the transcriptomes of these 
      organisms. This study investigates the soft tick Ornithodoros hermsi, conducting 
      histopathological examinations at bitten skin sites and tick whole-body 
      transcriptomic analyses across various developmental and feeding stages, 
      including larvae, 1st-nymphal, and 2nd-nymphal stages. The results revealed the 
      ability of O. hermsi to induce skin hemorrhage at the bite sites. Transcriptomic 
      analyses identified three consistent transcriptional profiles: unfed, early-fed 
      (6 h, 12 h, 24 h), and late-fed (5 days). The unfed profile exhibited high 
      transcriptional activity across most of the functional classes annotated. In 
      contrast, early-fed stages exhibited decreased expression of most functional 
      classes, except for the unknown, which is highly expressed. Finally, 
      transcriptional expression of most functional classes increased in the late-fed 
      groups, resembling the baseline expression observed in the unfed groups. These 
      findings highlight intense pre-feeding transcriptional activity in O. hermsi 
      ticks, aligning with their rapid-feeding strategy. Moreover, besides shedding 
      light on the temporal dynamics of key pathways during blood meal processing and 
      tick development, this study contributes significantly to the transcriptome 
      repertoire of a medically relevant soft tick species with relatively limited 
      prior knowledge.

AB  - Ornithodoros hermsi is a small, multi-host soft tick that feeds rapidly on blood 
      in all life stages, including larva, 2 to 5 nymphal instars (primarily 3), and 
      male and female. As adults, they can feed repeatedly and reproduce for many 
      years. O. hermsi is nidicolous and primarily inhabits nest cavities and burrows 
      of small rodents and birds, with chipmunks and tree squirrels serving as its 
      primary hosts. When no hosts are available, they can fast for several years. O. 
      hermsi is found in restricted habitats where their hosts live in coniferous pine 
      and Douglass fir forests at elevations of 1,500–10,000 feet in western North 
      America. Rustic forest cabins infested with rodents and O. hermsi are the primary 
      exposure sites for humans, who may be bitten while sleeping by these nocturnally 
      active ticks. O. hermsi bites cause erythema and local discomfort, but compared 
      to other species, effects appear benign. Other bite effects like toxicosis and 
      paralysis remain unknown.

TI  - Rickettsial Infection in Ticks from a National Park in the Cerrado Biome, 
      Midwestern Brazil.
LID - 10.3390/pathogens13010013 [doi]
LID - 13
AB  - This study was carried out from February 2020 to September 2021 in Parque 
      Nacional das Emas (PNE), a national park located in the Cerrado biome, midwestern 
      Brazil, as well as in surrounding rural properties. Serum and tick samples were 
      collected from dogs, terrestrial small mammals, and humans. Ticks were also 
      collected from the environment. Dogs were infested with Rhipicephalus linnaei 
      adults, whereas small mammals were infested by immature stages of Amblyomma spp., 
      Amblyomma triste, Amblyomma dubitatum, and Amblyomma coelebs. Ticks collected 
      from vegetation belonged to several species of the genus Amblyomma, including A. 
      coelebs, A. dubitatum, Amblyomma naponense, Amblyomma sculptum, and A. triste. 
      Two Rickettsia species were molecularly detected in ticks: Rickettsia parkeri in 
      A. triste from the vegetation and a Rickettsia sp. (designated Rickettsia sp. 
      strain PNE) in A. sculptum and A. triste collected from lowland tapirs (Tapirus 
      terrestris). Based on short gltA gene fragments, this rickettsial organism showed 
      99.7-100% to Rickettsia tillamookensis. Seroreactivity to Rickettsia antigens was 
      detected in 21.9% of dogs, 15.4% of small mammals, and 23.5% of humans. The 
      present study reveals the richness of ticks and demonstrates the circulation of 
      rickettsial agents in one of the largest conservation units in the Cerrado biome 
      in Brazil. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a rickettsial 
      phylogenetically related to R. tillamookensis in Brazil.

TI  - Prevention of heartworm infection in dogs using a combination of moxidectin, 
      imidacloprid and praziquantel: evidence from a randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 94
LID - 10.1007/s00436-023-08112-x [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a topical combination of 
      moxidectin 3.5%, imidacloprid 10% and praziquantel 10% for the prevention of 
      Dirofilaria immitis (Leidy, 1856) infection in dogs. For this purpose, a 
      randomized and controlled clinical trial was conducted between August 2021 and 
      October 2022, in the municipality of Goiana, state of Pernambuco, north-eastern 
      Brazil, where heartworm is highly prevalent. Of the 213 dogs initially sampled 
      (baseline), 68 (31.9%) were positive for adult antigens (SNAP 4Dx Plus, Idexx) 
      and/or microfilariae (modified Knott's test). On day 0, 140 negative dogs were 
      randomly included in the treatment and control groups, 70 animals each. During 
      the study, 60 dogs (34 treated and 26 untreated) were removed for different 
      reasons. At the end of the study (day 360 ± 2), 36 treated and 44 untreated were 
      sampled and included in the efficacy calculation. The efficacy against the 
      development of adults and microfilariae was 84.7%, with only one treated dog 
      being positive for adult antigens but negative for microfilariae. On the other 
      hand, eight untreated dogs were positive for adult antigens and/or microfilariae, 
      resulting in a significant difference in the number of positives between groups 
      (Chi-square test = 4.706, df = 1, P = 0.0301). Remarkably, the efficacy against 
      the appearance of D. immitis microfilariae was 100% (i.e., all treated dogs 
      negative) and three untreated dogs were positive for microfilariae. The topical 
      combination of moxidectin 3.5%, imidacloprid 10% and praziquantel 10% 
      significantly reduced the risk of D. immitis infection in treated dogs as 
      compared with untreated dogs, in a highly endemic area in north-eastern Brazil.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The tick Amblyomma cajennense sensu stricto (A. cajennense s.s.) 
      frequently parasitizes animals and humans in the Amazon biome, in addition to 
      being a vector of Rickettsia amblyommatis. In the present study, we evaluated 
      both the population dynamics of A. cajennense s.s. in a degraded area of the 
      Amazon biome and the presence of rickettsial organisms in this tick population. 
      METHODS: The study was carried out in a rural area of the Santa Inês municipality 
      (altitude: 24 m a.s.l.), Maranhão state, Brazil. Ticks were collected from the 
      environment for 24 consecutive months, from June 2021 to May 2023. The region is 
      characterized by two warm seasons: a rainy season (November-May) and a dry season 
      (June-October). We characterized the temporal activity of A. cajennense s.s. on 
      the vegetation by examining questing activity for each life stage (larvae, 
      nymphs, adults [males and females]) in relation to the dry and rainy season. 
      Ticks collected in this study were randomly selected and individually tested by a 
      TaqMan real-time PCR assay that targeted a 147-bp fragment of the rickettsial 
      gltA gene. RESULTS: Overall, 1843 (62.4%) adults (52.6% females, 47.4% males), 
      1110 (37.6%) nymphs and 398 larval clusters were collected. All adult females and 
      nymphs were morphologically identified as A. cajennense s.s. Larval activity was 
      observed from April to December, with a peak from June to September (dry season); 
      nymph abundance peaked from September to November (transition period between dry 
      and rainy seasons); and adult ticks were abundant from October to May 
      (spring/summer/early autumn). The infection rate by R. amblyommatis in A. 
      cajennense s.s. ticks was at least 7% (7/99). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a 
      1-year generation pattern for A. cajennense s.s., with a well-defined seasonality 
      of larvae, nymphs and adults in the Amazon biome. Larvae predominate during the 
      dry season, nymphs are most abundant in the dry-rainy season transition and 
      adults are most abundant in the rainy season. The presence of R. amblyommatis in 
      adult ticks suggests that animals and humans in the study region are at risk of 
      infection by this species belonging to the spotted fever group of Rickettsia.

TI  - Detection of an Undescribed Babesia sp. in Capybaras and Amblyomma Ticks in 
      Central-Western Brazil.
LID - 10.3390/ani13010094 [doi]
LID - 94
AB  - Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are the largest rodents on Earth. While 
      capybaras are hosts for various tick species, there is limited information 
      regarding the tick-borne pathogens they can carry. We investigated the presence 
      of piroplasmids and Ehrlichia spp. in capybaras and their associated ticks in two 
      peri-urban areas in Goiás state, central-western Brazil. Blood samples collected 
      from 23 capybaras were used to investigate the presence of piroplasmids and 
      Ehrlichia spp. in stained-blood smears and by PCR. Ticks collected from the 
      capybaras were identified morphologically and also tested using PCR for the same 
      pathogens. A total of 955 ticks were collected, including 822 (86.1%) Amblyomma 
      sculptum, 132 (13.8%) Amblyomma dubitatum, and one (0.1%) unidentified larva of 
      Amblyomma sp. Neither the capybaras nor ticks were positive for Ehrlichia spp. 
      However, a stained-blood smear examination revealed the presence of ring-stage 
      and pyriform-shaped merozoites in the erythrocytes of one (4.4%) capybara. In the 
      same way, 47.8% (11/23) and 19.9% (36/181) of blood samples and ticks, 
      respectively, were positive for piroplasmids in the PCR. We successfully 
      sequenced a partial 18S rRNA gene fragment of four samples (two capybaras, one A. 
      sculptum, and one A. dubitatum), and the phylogenetic reconstruction disclosed 
      that the organism reported in the present study clusters within the genus 
      Babesia. Further research is required for a formal delineation of this species 
      (designated as Babesia sp. strain Capybara) and to investigate the hypothesis of 
      A. dubitatum and A. sculptum ticks being vectors.

AB  - Canine vector-borne pathogens (CVBPs) comprise a group of disease agents mainly 
      transmitted by ticks, fleas, mosquitoes and sand flies. In this study, we 
      assessed the presence of CVBPs in an Afro-descendent community (Quilombola) of 
      northeastern, Brazil. Dog blood samples (n = 201) were collected and analyzed by 
      rapid test for the detection of antibodies against Leishmania spp., Anaplasma 
      spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), and antigens of 
      Dirofilaria immitis. In addition, polymerase chain reactions were performed for 
      Anaplasmataceae, Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Rickettsia spp. and B. 
      burgdorferi s.l. Overall, 66.7% of the dogs scored positive to at least one 
      pathogen at serological and/or molecular methods. Antibodies against Ehrlichia 
      spp. were the most frequently detected (57.2%; n = 115/201), followed by 
      Anaplasma spp. (8.5%; n = 17/201), Leishmania spp. (8.5%; n = 17/201) and B. 
      burgdorferi s.l. (0.5%; n = 1/201). For D. immitis, 11 out of 201 (5.5%) animals 
      scored positive. At the molecular analysis, 10.4% (n = 21/201) of the samples 
      scored positive for Babesia spp./Hepatozoon spp., followed by Anaplasmataceae 
      (5.0%; n = 10/201) and Rickettsia spp. (3.0%; n = 6/201). All samples were 
      negative for B. burgdorferi s.l. Our data demonstrated the presence of CVBPs in 
      the studied population, with a high seropositivity for Ehrlichia spp. In 
      addition, considering the detection of zoonotic pathogens in dogs and their 
      relationship with people from Quilombola communities, effective control 
      strategies are advocated for minimizing the risk of infection in this socially 
      vulnerable human population and their pets.

AB  - Ornithodoros mimon is an argasid tick primarily associated with bats that also 
      infest other animals including birds, opossums and humans. In this paper, we 
      report the finding of an argasid species resembling O. mimon, which similarly may 
      be found in human dwellings and parasitize humans in Brazil. We also provide 
      molecular evidence that this argasid tick species may carry a rickettsial 
      organism, whose pathogenicity remains unknown. A total of 16 ticks (two females, 
      two males and 12 nymphs) were collected in the bedroom and in the attic of a 
      human house, where cases of "insect" bites have been recurrent. These ticks were 
      identified morphologically and genetically as Ornithodoros cf. mimon. Upon PCR 
      testing, four of these ticks (one female and three nymphs) were positive for 
      human blood and for a bacterium closely related to "Candidatus Rickettsia 
      paranaensis". In conclusion, we report for the first time in Brazil an argasid 
      tick species morphologically and genetically related to O. mimon, which feeds on 
      humans and carry a rickettsial organism belonging to the spotted fever group. 
      Further studies are needed to formally assess the taxonomic status of this tick 
      species and also to investigate the pathogenicity of its associated rickettsial 
      organism.

AB  - Proinflammatory cytokine secretion determines the infection course in 
      leishmaniasis. The immunopathology of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by 
      Leishmania infantum is characterized by low Leishmania-specific IFN-γ and IL-17 
      production. Mutations in the human IL-17 gene promoter alter cytokine expression 
      and may increase the susceptibility of humans to some infectious diseases. In 
      this study, we correlated canine IL-17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      with anti-Leishmania IgG levels, parasite load and external clinical signs in 
      dogs naturally exposed to L. infantum in Brazil. A higher frequency (Chi-square 
      test: X(2)= 5.378, df= 1, P= 0.020) of major alleles was observed among dogs 
      showing no external clinical signs attributable to Leishmania infection. A high 
      proportion of A allele carriers (mutant) were observed among dogs with high 
      antibody levels, although differences were not statistically significant 
      (Chi-square test: X(2)= 4.410, df= 4, P= 0.353), as compared to dogs with low 
      antibody levels. In general, the association of canine IL-17 SNPs with disease 
      expression or disease exasperation did not reach enough statistical power to 
      allow the use of these mutations as prognostic markers. This knowledge may pave 
      the way for further investigations on the genetic aspects of CanL and its 
      immunotherapy.

AB  - Reptiles and amphibians are exceptional hosts for different ectoparasites, 
      including mites and ticks. In this study, we investigated tick infestations on 
      reptiles and amphibians trapped in Central Amazonia, and also assessed the 
      presence of rickettsial infections in the collected ticks. From September 2016 to 
      September 2019, 385 reptiles (350 lizards, 20 snakes, 12 tortoises, and three 
      caimans) and 120 amphibians (119 anurans and one caecilian) were captured and 
      examined for ectoparasites. Overall, 35 (10%) lizards, three (25%) tortoises and 
      one (0.8%) toad were parasitized by ticks (124 larvae, 32 nymphs, and 22 adults). 
      In lizards, tick infestation varied significantly according to landscape category 
      and age group. Based on combined morphological and molecular analyses, these 
      ticks were identified as Amblyomma humerale (14 larvae, 12 nymphs, 19 males, and 
      one female), Amblyomma nodosum (three larvae, one nymph, and one female), and 
      Amblyomma rotundatum (four larvae, three nymphs, and one female), and Amblyomma 
      spp. (103 larvae and 16 nymphs). Our study presents the first records of A. 
      nodosum in the Amazonas state and suggests that teiid lizards are important hosts 
      for larvae and nymphs of A. humerale in Central Amazonia. Moreover, a nymph of A. 
      humerale collected from a common tegu (Tupinambis teguixin) was found positive 
      for Rickettsia amblyommatis, which agrees with previous reports, suggesting that 
      the A. humerale-R. amblyommatis relationship may be more common than currently 
      recognized.

AB  - Birds are important hosts for various tick species, playing a significant role in 
      their biological life cycle and dispersion. In this study, we investigated tick 
      infestations on birds trapped in an urban remnant of Atlantic Forest in 
      Pernambuco state, Brazil. From February 2015 to March 2017, 541 birds belonging 
      to 52 species were trapped with mist nets and examined for ectoparasites. Birds 
      trapped in the late successional forest were significantly more infested than 
      birds trapped in the early successional forest. In the same way, ectoparasite 
      infestation varied significantly according to bird weight and collection plot. 
      Overall, 198 birds (36.6%) belonging to 27 species were parasitized by 
      ectoparasites (i.e., ticks, lice and/or mites). Ectoparasites were effectively 
      collected from 111 birds, of which 99 belonging to 20 species were infested by 
      ticks (n = 261), namely, Amblyomma longirostre (13 nymphs), Amblyomma nodosum (21 
      nymphs), Amblyomma varium (one nymph), and Amblyomma spp. (five nymphs and 221 
      larvae). Most of the ticks (> 90%) were collected from Passeriformes. This study 
      provides the second record of A. varium in Pernambuco state and confirms that 
      birds, especially Passeriformes, are important hosts for larvae and nymphs of 
      Amblyomma spp. in the Atlantic Forest biome of Pernambuco.

AB  - Lutzomyia longipalpis sensu lato is a complex of phlebotomine sand fly species, 
      which are widespread in the Neotropics. They have a great medico-veterinary 
      importance due their role as vectors of Leishmania infantum, the causative agent 
      of visceral leishmaniasis. Morphological variations of Lu. longipalpis s.l. males 
      were reported in the late 1960s in Brazil. Male populations can present either 
      one pair of spots on third abdominal tergites or two pairs on third and fourth 
      ones, namely 1S and 2S phenotypes, respectively. Since then, there has been much 
      interest on the taxonomic status of Lu. longipalpis s.l. Thereafter, several 
      lines of evidence have been congruent in suggesting the existence of an uncertain 
      number of cryptic species within Lu. longipalpis s.l. in Brazil. Herein, a 525 
      bp-fragment of the period gene was used for assessing the genetic structure and 
      phylogenetic relationship of Lu. longipalpis s.l. populations in Brazil. We 
      performed two set of analyses, first we originally sequenced three populations 
      (Passira, Santarém and Teresina) of Lu. longipalpis s.l. and compared them. 
      Thereafter, we performed a global analysis including in our dataset other three 
      pairs of sympatric populations of Lu. longipalpis s.l. from three Brazilian 
      localities available in GenBank. Fixed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      sharing, maximum likelihood inference, genetic structure and haplotype analyses 
      revealed the presence of two genetic groups, one composed of Teresina population, 
      and the other encompassing Passira and Santarém populations. The global analysis 
      reflected the first of its kind, and two prominent groups were observed: the 
      clade I comprising Teresina 1S, Bodocó 1S, Caririaçu 1S and Sobral 1S; and the 
      clade II encompassing Passira 2S, Santarém 1S, Bodocó 2S, Caririaçu 2S and Sobral 
      2S. Genetic differentiation data suggested a limited gene flow between 
      populations of the clade I versus clade II. Our results disclosed the presence of 
      two prominent genetic groups, which could reasonably represent populations of Lu. 
      longipalpis s.l. whose males produce the same courtship song.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology and prevalence of babesial infections in dogs in two 
      hyperendemic foci in Brazil.

AB  - Babesial parasites are some of the most ubiquitous blood pathogens and 
      consequently have considerable worldwide veterinary impact. Dogs living in the 
      tropics are highly exposed to babesial parasites, particularly to Babesia vogeli. 
      Limited data on the seroprevalence and molecular prevalence of Babesia spp. in 
      dogs are available in Latin America. We conducted a cross-sectional study 
      combining serological and molecular tests to estimate the seroprevalence and 
      molecular epidemiology of Babesia spp. infections in dogs in two hyperendemic 
      foci in Brazil. A total of 630 privately owned dogs (417 from Goiana 
      municipality, Pernambuco state, north-eastern Brazil, and 213 from São Joaquim de 
      Bicas municipality, Minas Gerais state, south-eastern Brazil) were sampled and 
      molecularly and serologically tested for Babesia spp. Overall, 519 dogs (82.4%) 
      presented detectable IgG antibodies against Babesia spp., and seropositivity was 
      significantly higher in dogs older than 1 year. Molecularly, 34 dogs (5.4%) were 
      positive for a ~ 200 bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia spp. and 88 
      (14.0%) for a longer fragment (~ 450 bp) of the same gene of Babesia spp. and 
      other protozoa. The 18S rRNA gene sequences generated herein corresponded to B. 
      vogeli (n = 52) or Hepatozoon canis (n = 20). This study confirms a high level of 
      exposure to B. vogeli in two areas of Brazil and highlights that most of the dogs 
      living in these areas are infected during the course of their life, reflected by 
      increased seroprevalence in older dogs. Increased awareness and prevention of 
      tick-borne protozoa infections in dogs from Brazil and Latin America are urgently 
      needed.

AB  - The genus Amblyomma is the most representative tick genus in Brazil and some 
      species act as vectors of pathogenic organisms to animals and humans. Information 
      on the seasonal dynamics of Amblyomma spp. as well as on rickettsial organisms 
      infecting these ticks in some regions in Brazil is still fragmentary. Herein, we 
      investigated the seasonal dynamics and rickettsial infections in Amblyomma 
      dubitatum ticks collected in the Atlantic forest biome in north-eastern Brazil. 
      Using carbon dioxide traps, ticks were collected monthly for two consecutive 
      years. In total, 15,789 ticks were collected: 69 females (0.4%), 116 males 
      (0.7%), 1,067 nymphs (6.8%), and 14,537 larvae (92.1%). All nymphs, females and 
      males were identified as A. dubitatum, whereas larvae were identified as 
      Amblyomma spp. Larvae were more frequent in summer (77% of the larvae collected), 
      whereas nymphs were collected with similar frequency in summer (32.8%), autumn 
      (30.0%) and spring (28.4%). Adults were more frequent in spring (47.6%). A total 
      of 648 ticks (485 nymphs, 60 females, and 103 males) were tested by PCR for the 
      gltA gene of Rickettsia spp. and 87 (13.4%; 95% CI: 10.9-16.3%) were positive. A 
      consensus sequence (size, 350 bp) of 66 gltA gene sequences indicate that the 
      organism detected herein is similar to Rickettsia tamurae, Rickettsia monacencis 
      and Rickettsia sp. strain Pampulha. One of these positive samples was also 
      positive for the ompA gene of spotted fever group rickettsiae, but attempts to 
      sequence the amplicon were not successful. We also tested this sample by a PCR 
      targeting the rickettsial htrA gene, but no amplification product could be 
      detected. This study indicates that A. dubitatum may be a common tick in areas 
      where capybaras are present in north-eastern Brazil, occurring during the whole 
      year. It also suggests the circulation of a spotted fever group rickettsia in 
      this A. dubitatum population, whose identity has yet to be determined.

AB  - A species complex (= species group, species series) is an assemblage of species, 
      which are related morphologically and phylogenetically. Recent research has 
      revealed several arthropod vector species that were believed to be a single 
      nominal species actually representing a group of closely related species, which 
      are sometimes morphologically indistinguishable at one or more developmental 
      stages. In some instances, differences in terms of vector competence, capacity, 
      or both have been recorded. It highlights the importance of detecting and 
      studying species complexes to improve our understanding of pathogen transmission 
      patterns, which may be vectored more or less efficiently by different species 
      within the complex. Considering more than 540 species, about one-third of the 
      phlebotomine sand flies in the New World present males and/or females 
      morphologically indistinguishable to one or more species. Remarkably, several of 
      these species may act in transmission of pathogenic agents. In this article, we 
      review recent research on species complexes in phlebotomine sand flies from the 
      Americas. Possible practical implications of recently acquired knowledge and 
      future research needs are also discussed.

LID - e0007553
AB  - In the present study, we assessed the annual screening coverage (i.e., the 
      percentage of dogs that are screened for anti-Leishmania antibodies annually) in 
      the municipality of Sobral, Ceará state, Brazil. Data on the number of dogs 
      screened during 2008-2017 (except 2010) were obtained from the Centre for 
      Zoonoses Control of Sobral. The annual screening coverage during 2012-2017 was 
      calculated. Data on human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases during 2008-2017 were 
      compiled from the National Disease Notification System. Correlation analyses were 
      performed to assess the correlation between canine and human data. During 
      2008-2017, 73,964 dogs (range, 0 to 13,980 dogs/year) were serologically screened 
      and 2,833 (3.8%) were positive. The annual screening coverage during 2012-2017 
      ranged from 11.1% to 45.7%. There were no significant correlations between the 
      number of dogs culled and the number of human VL cases, canine positivity and 
      human VL incidence, number of dogs culled and human VL incidence, or between 
      canine positivity and number of human VL cases. An inconsistent and relatively 
      low annual screening coverage was found in the study area, with no dog being 
      screened in 2010 due to the lack of serological tests. Our results highlight that 
      many dogs potentially infected with Leishmania infantum have been virtually 
      overlooked by public health workers in the study area, perhaps with a negative, 
      yet underestimated, impact on the control of canine and human VL. Hence, the 
      failure of the dog culling strategy in controlling human VL in Brazil may be due 
      to the low screening coverage and low percentage of culled dogs, rather than the 
      absence of associations between canine and human infections.

      of the cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale L.). The complete genome sequencing of 
      the strain IBSBF2579 was done on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The de novo 
      assembly of the X. citri pv. anacardii strain IBSBF2579 genome yielded 133 
      contigs, with a size of 5,329,247 bp and a G+C content of 64.03%. The prediction 
      was performed by GeneMarkS and the automatic annotation by Rapid Annotations 
      using Subsystems Technology (RAST), with 4,406 identified genes.

AB  - Colletotrichum musae is an important cosmopolitan pathogenic fungus that causes 
      anthracnose in banana fruit. The entire genome of C. musae isolate GM20 (CMM 
      4420), originally isolated from infected banana fruit from Alagoas State, Brazil, 
      was sequenced and annotated. The pathogen genomic DNA was sequenced on HiSeq 
      Illumina platform. The C. musae GM20 genome has 50,635,197 bp with G + C content 
      of 53.74% and in its present assembly has 2763 scaffolds, harboring 13,451 
      putative genes with an average length of 1626 bp. Gene prediction and annotation 
      was performed by Funannotate pipeline, using a pattern for gene identification 
      based on BUSCO.
