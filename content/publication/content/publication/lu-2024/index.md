abstract: "BACKGROUND: Female ticks remain attached to their host for multiple days\
  \ to  complete a blood meal. This prolonged feeding period is accompanied by a significant\
  \ increase in the tick's size and body weight, paralleled by noteworthy changes\
  \ to the tick midgut. While the midgut is recognized for its established role in\
  \ blood storage and processing, its importance extends to playing a crucial role\
  \ in the acquisition, survival, and proliferation of pathogens. Despite this, our\
  \ overall understanding of tick midgut biology is limited. RESULTS: Our transcriptome\
  \ analysis identified 15,599 putative DNA coding sequences (CDS), which were classified\
  \ into 26 functional groups. Dimensional and differential expression analyses revealed\
  \ four primary transcriptional profiles corresponding to unfed, slow-feeding, transitory\
  \ (from slow- to rapid-feeding), and rapid-feeding stages. Additionally, comparing\
  \ the current dataset with previously deposited transcriptome from other tick species\
  \ allowed the identification of commonly expressed transcripts across different\
  \ feeding stages. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a detailed temporal resolution\
  \ of numerous metabolic pathways in the midgut of A. americanum adult females throughout\
  \ the feeding process, highlighting the dynamic transcriptional regulation of the\
  \ tick's midgut as feeding progresses. Furthermore, we identified conserved transcripts\
  \ across three different tick species that exhibit similar expression patterns.\
  \ This knowledge not only enhances our understanding of the physiological processes\
  \ within the tick midgut but also opens up potential avenues for developing control\
  \ methods that target multiple tick species."
