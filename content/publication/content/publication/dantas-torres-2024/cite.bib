 abstract = {The Rhipicephalus sanguineus group is an assembly of species morphologically and  phylogenetically related to Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu stricto. The taxonomy and systematics of this species group have remained obscure for a long time, but extensive research conducted during the past two decades has closed many knowledge gaps. These research advancements culminated in the redescription of R. sanguineus sensu stricto, with subsequent revalidation of former synonyms (Rhipicephalus linnaei, Rhipicephalus rutilus, and Rhipicephalus secundus) and even the description of new species (Rhipicephalus afranicus and Rhipicephalus hibericus). With a much clearer picture of the taxonomy of these species, we present an updated list of species belonging to the R. sanguineus group, along with a review of their geographic distribution and vector role for various pathogens of animals and humans. We also identify knowledge gaps to be bridged in future studies.},
