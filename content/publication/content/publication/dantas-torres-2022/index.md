abstract: Ornithodoros mimon is an argasid tick primarily associated with bats that
  also  infest other animals including birds, opossums and humans. In this paper,
  we report the finding of an argasid species resembling O. mimon, which similarly
  may be found in human dwellings and parasitize humans in Brazil. We also provide
  molecular evidence that this argasid tick species may carry a rickettsial organism,
  whose pathogenicity remains unknown. A total of 16 ticks (two females, two males
  and 12 nymphs) were collected in the bedroom and in the attic of a human house,
  where cases of \"insect\" bites have been recurrent. These ticks were identified
  morphologically and genetically as Ornithodoros cf. mimon. Upon PCR testing, four
  of these ticks (one female and three nymphs) were positive for human blood and for
  a bacterium closely related to \"Candidatus Rickettsia paranaensis\". In conclusion,
  we report for the first time in Brazil an argasid tick species morphologically and
  genetically related to O. mimon, which feeds on humans and carry a rickettsial organism
  belonging to the spotted fever group. Further studies are needed to formally assess
  the taxonomic status of this tick species and also to investigate the pathogenicity
  of its associated rickettsial organism.
