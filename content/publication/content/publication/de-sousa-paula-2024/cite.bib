 abstract = {Blood-feeding behavior has independently evolved in arthropods multiple times.  Unlike hard ticks, soft ticks employ a rapid-feeding strategy for hematophagy, and there are comparatively limited studies on the transcriptomes of these organisms. This study investigates the soft tick Ornithodoros hermsi, conducting histopathological examinations at bitten skin sites and tick whole-body transcriptomic analyses across various developmental and feeding stages, including larvae, 1st-nymphal, and 2nd-nymphal stages. The results revealed the ability of O. hermsi to induce skin hemorrhage at the bite sites. Transcriptomic analyses identified three consistent transcriptional profiles: unfed, early-fed (6 h, 12 h, 24 h), and late-fed (5 days). The unfed profile exhibited high transcriptional activity across most of the functional classes annotated. In contrast, early-fed stages exhibited decreased expression of most functional classes, except for the unknown, which is highly expressed. Finally, transcriptional expression of most functional classes increased in the late-fed groups, resembling the baseline expression observed in the unfed groups. These findings highlight intense pre-feeding transcriptional activity in O. hermsi ticks, aligning with their rapid-feeding strategy. Moreover, besides shedding light on the temporal dynamics of key pathways during blood meal processing and tick development, this study contributes significantly to the transcriptome repertoire of a medically relevant soft tick species with relatively limited prior knowledge.},
