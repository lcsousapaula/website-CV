abstract: 'Blood-feeding behavior has independently evolved in arthropods multiple
  times.  Unlike hard ticks, soft ticks employ a rapid-feeding strategy for hematophagy,
  and there are comparatively limited studies on the transcriptomes of these organisms.
  This study investigates the soft tick Ornithodoros hermsi, conducting histopathological
  examinations at bitten skin sites and tick whole-body transcriptomic analyses across
  various developmental and feeding stages, including larvae, 1st-nymphal, and 2nd-nymphal
  stages. The results revealed the ability of O. hermsi to induce skin hemorrhage
  at the bite sites. Transcriptomic analyses identified three consistent transcriptional
  profiles: unfed, early-fed (6 h, 12 h, 24 h), and late-fed (5 days). The unfed profile
  exhibited high transcriptional activity across most of the functional classes annotated.
  In contrast, early-fed stages exhibited decreased expression of most functional
  classes, except for the unknown, which is highly expressed. Finally, transcriptional
  expression of most functional classes increased in the late-fed groups, resembling
  the baseline expression observed in the unfed groups. These findings highlight intense
  pre-feeding transcriptional activity in O. hermsi ticks, aligning with their rapid-feeding
  strategy. Moreover, besides shedding light on the temporal dynamics of key pathways
  during blood meal processing and tick development, this study contributes significantly
  to the transcriptome repertoire of a medically relevant soft tick species with relatively
  limited prior knowledge.'
