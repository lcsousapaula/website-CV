abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The tick Amblyomma cajennense sensu stricto (A. cajennense
  s.s.)  frequently parasitizes animals and humans in the Amazon biome, in addition
  to being a vector of Rickettsia amblyommatis. In the present study, we evaluated
  both the population dynamics of A. cajennense s.s. in a degraded area of the Amazon
  biome and the presence of rickettsial organisms in this tick population. METHODS:
  The study was carried out in a rural area of the Santa Inês municipality (altitude:
  24 m a.s.l.), Maranhão state, Brazil. Ticks were collected from the environment
  for 24 consecutive months, from June 2021 to May 2023. The region is characterized
  by two warm seasons: a rainy season (November-May) and a dry season (June-October).
  We characterized the temporal activity of A. cajennense s.s. on the vegetation by
  examining questing activity for each life stage (larvae, nymphs, adults [males and
  females]) in relation to the dry and rainy season. Ticks collected in this study
  were randomly selected and individually tested by a TaqMan real-time PCR assay that
  targeted a 147-bp fragment of the rickettsial gltA gene. RESULTS: Overall, 1843
  (62.4%) adults (52.6% females, 47.4% males), 1110 (37.6%) nymphs and 398 larval
  clusters were collected. All adult females and nymphs were morphologically identified
  as A. cajennense s.s. Larval activity was observed from April to December, with
  a peak from June to September (dry season); nymph abundance peaked from September
  to November (transition period between dry and rainy seasons); and adult ticks were
  abundant from October to May (spring/summer/early autumn). The infection rate by
  R. amblyommatis in A. cajennense s.s. ticks was at least 7% (7/99). CONCLUSION:
  Our data suggest a 1-year generation pattern for A. cajennense s.s., with a well-defined
  seasonality of larvae, nymphs and adults in the Amazon biome. Larvae predominate
  during the dry season, nymphs are most abundant in the dry-rainy season transition
  and adults are most abundant in the rainy season. The presence of R. amblyommatis
  in adult ticks suggests that animals and humans in the study region are at risk
  of infection by this species belonging to the spotted fever group of Rickettsia.'
