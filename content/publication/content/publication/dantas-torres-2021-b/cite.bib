 abstract = {The genus Amblyomma is the most representative tick genus in Brazil and some  species act as vectors of pathogenic organisms to animals and humans. Information on the seasonal dynamics of Amblyomma spp. as well as on rickettsial organisms infecting these ticks in some regions in Brazil is still fragmentary. Herein, we investigated the seasonal dynamics and rickettsial infections in Amblyomma dubitatum ticks collected in the Atlantic forest biome in north-eastern Brazil. Using carbon dioxide traps, ticks were collected monthly for two consecutive years. In total, 15,789 ticks were collected: 69 females (0.4%), 116 males (0.7%), 1,067 nymphs (6.8%), and 14,537 larvae (92.1%). All nymphs, females and males were identified as A. dubitatum, whereas larvae were identified as Amblyomma spp. Larvae were more frequent in summer (77% of the larvae collected), whereas nymphs were collected with similar frequency in summer (32.8%), autumn (30.0%) and spring (28.4%). Adults were more frequent in spring (47.6%). A total of 648 ticks (485 nymphs, 60 females, and 103 males) were tested by PCR for the gltA gene of Rickettsia spp. and 87 (13.4%; 95% CI: 10.9-16.3%) were positive. A consensus sequence (size, 350 bp) of 66 gltA gene sequences indicate that the organism detected herein is similar to Rickettsia tamurae, Rickettsia monacencis and Rickettsia sp. strain Pampulha. One of these positive samples was also positive for the ompA gene of spotted fever group rickettsiae, but attempts to sequence the amplicon were not successful. We also tested this sample by a PCR targeting the rickettsial htrA gene, but no amplification product could be detected. This study indicates that A. dubitatum may be a common tick in areas where capybaras are present in north-eastern Brazil, occurring during the whole year. It also suggests the circulation of a spotted fever group rickettsia in this A. dubitatum population, whose identity has yet to be determined.},
