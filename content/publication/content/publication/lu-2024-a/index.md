abstract: "BACKGROUND: Female ticks remain attached to their host for multiple days\
  \ to  complete a blood meal. This prolonged feeding period is accompanied by a significant\
  \ increase in the tick's size and body weight, paralleled by noteworthy changes\
  \ to the tick midgut. While the midgut is recognized for its established role in\
  \ blood storage and processing, its importance extends to playing a crucial role\
  \ in the acquisition, survival, and proliferation of pathogens. Despite this, our\
  \ overall understanding of tick midgut biology is limited. RESULTS: We conducted\
  \ a comprehensive longitudinal transcriptome analysis of the midgut in adult female\
  \ A. americanum ticks across various feeding stages, including unfed, slow-feeding,\
  \ and rapid-feeding phases. Our analysis revealed 15,599 putative DNA coding sequences\
  \ (CDS) classified within 26 functional groups. Dimensional and differential expression\
  \ analysis highlighted the dynamic transcriptional changes in the tick midgut as\
  \ feeding progresses, particularly during the initial period of feeding and the\
  \ transition from the slow-feeding to the rapid-feeding phase. Additionally, we\
  \ performed an orthology analysis comparing our dataset with midgut transcriptomes\
  \ from other hard ticks, such as Ixodes scapularis and Rhipicephalus microplus.\
  \ This comparison allowed us to identify transcripts commonly expressed during different\
  \ feeding phases across these three species. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a\
  \ detailed temporal resolution of numerous metabolic pathways in A. americanum,\
  \ emphasizing the dynamic transcriptional changes occurring in the tick midgut throughout\
  \ the feeding process. Furthermore, we identified conserved transcripts across three\
  \ different tick species that exhibit similar expression patterns. This knowledge\
  \ has significant implications for future research aimed at deciphering the physiological\
  \ pathways relevant within the tick midgut. It also offers potential avenues for\
  \ developing control methods that target multiple tick species."
