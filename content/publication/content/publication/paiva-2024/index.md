abstract: "Leishmaniases are a group of neglected diseases of significant public health\
  \  concern, with Brazil being the primary focus of this disease in the Americas.\
  \ The municipality of Sobral, in the state of Ceará, is a historical focus of visceral\
  \ leishmaniasis in both humans and dogs, but data on Leishmania spp. infections\
  \ in cats are limited. Between April 2021 and February 2022, 205 cats from a referral\
  \ hospital population were sampled and tested for Leishmania spp. by real-time PCR.\
  \ Eight cats (3.9%; 95% CI: 1.7-7.5%) tested positive. Among these, three (37.5%)\
  \ displayed clinical signs compatible with feline leishmaniosis. Non-domiciled cats\
  \ showed significantly higher positivity compared to domiciled ones (Fisher's exact\
  \ test, P = 0.0124). Considering their potential role as reservoirs of L. infantum,\
  \ it is crucial to conduct further studies to understand the Leishmania spp. circulating\
  \ among cats in Sobral and to implement measures for reducing their exposure to\
  \ phlebotomine sand fly vectors in this important focus of leishmaniases."
