abstract: Reptiles and amphibians are exceptional hosts for different ectoparasites,  including
  mites and ticks. In this study, we investigated tick infestations on reptiles and
  amphibians trapped in Central Amazonia, and also assessed the presence of rickettsial
  infections in the collected ticks. From September 2016 to September 2019, 385 reptiles
  (350 lizards, 20 snakes, 12 tortoises, and three caimans) and 120 amphibians (119
  anurans and one caecilian) were captured and examined for ectoparasites. Overall,
  35 (10%) lizards, three (25%) tortoises and one (0.8%) toad were parasitized by
  ticks (124 larvae, 32 nymphs, and 22 adults). In lizards, tick infestation varied
  significantly according to landscape category and age group. Based on combined morphological
  and molecular analyses, these ticks were identified as Amblyomma humerale (14 larvae,
  12 nymphs, 19 males, and one female), Amblyomma nodosum (three larvae, one nymph,
  and one female), and Amblyomma rotundatum (four larvae, three nymphs, and one female),
  and Amblyomma spp. (103 larvae and 16 nymphs). Our study presents the first records
  of A. nodosum in the Amazonas state and suggests that teiid lizards are important
  hosts for larvae and nymphs of A. humerale in Central Amazonia. Moreover, a nymph
  of A. humerale collected from a common tegu (Tupinambis teguixin) was found positive
  for Rickettsia amblyommatis, which agrees with previous reports, suggesting that
  the A. humerale-R. amblyommatis relationship may be more common than currently recognized.
