abstract: 'This study was carried out from February 2020 to September 2021 in Parque  Nacional
  das Emas (PNE), a national park located in the Cerrado biome, midwestern Brazil,
  as well as in surrounding rural properties. Serum and tick samples were collected
  from dogs, terrestrial small mammals, and humans. Ticks were also collected from
  the environment. Dogs were infested with Rhipicephalus linnaei adults, whereas small
  mammals were infested by immature stages of Amblyomma spp., Amblyomma triste, Amblyomma
  dubitatum, and Amblyomma coelebs. Ticks collected from vegetation belonged to several
  species of the genus Amblyomma, including A. coelebs, A. dubitatum, Amblyomma naponense,
  Amblyomma sculptum, and A. triste. Two Rickettsia species were molecularly detected
  in ticks: Rickettsia parkeri in A. triste from the vegetation and a Rickettsia sp.
  (designated Rickettsia sp. strain PNE) in A. sculptum and A. triste collected from
  lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris). Based on short gltA gene fragments, this rickettsial
  organism showed 99.7-100% to Rickettsia tillamookensis. Seroreactivity to Rickettsia
  antigens was detected in 21.9% of dogs, 15.4% of small mammals, and 23.5% of humans.
  The present study reveals the richness of ticks and demonstrates the circulation
  of rickettsial agents in one of the largest conservation units in the Cerrado biome
  in Brazil. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a rickettsial phylogenetically
  related to R. tillamookensis in Brazil.'
