abstract: Ticks obtain a blood meal by lacerating small blood vessels and ingesting
  the  blood that flows to the feeding site, which triggers various host responses.
  However, ticks face the challenge of wound healing, a process involving hemostasis,
  inflammation, cell proliferation and migration, and remodeling, hindering blood
  acquisition. To overcome these obstacles, tick salivary glands produce an array
  of bioactive molecules. Here, we characterize ixochymostatin, an Ixodes scapularis
  protein belonging to the trypsin inhibitor-like (TIL) family. It is expressed in
  multiple developmental stages and in tick salivary glands and acts as a slow and
  tight-binding inhibitor of chymase, cathepsin G, and chymotrypsin. Predictions for
  the tertiary structure complex between ixochymostatin and chymase suggest a direct
  interaction between the inhibitor reactive site loop and protease active sites.
  In vitro, ixochymostatin protects the endothelial cell barrier against chymase degrading
  action, decreasing cell permeability. In vivo, it reduces vascular permeability
  induced by chymase and compound 48/80, a mast cell degranulator agonist, in a mouse
  model. Additionally, ixochymostatin inhibits the chymase-dependent generation of
  vasoconstrictor peptides. Antibodies against ixochymostatin neutralize its inhibitory
  properties, with epitope mapping identifying potential neutralization regions. Ixochymostatin
  emerges as a novel tick protein modulating host responses against tick feeding,
  facilitating blood acquisition.
