The taxonomy and systematics of this species group have remained obscure for a long time, but extensive research conducted during the past two decades has closed many knowledge gaps. These research advancements culminated in the redescription of R. sanguineus sensu stricto, with subsequent revalidation of former synonyms (Rhipicephalus linnaei, Rhipicephalus rutilus, and Rhipicephalus secundus) and even the description of new species (Rhipicephalus afranicus and Rhipicephalus hibericus). With a much clearer picture of the taxonomy of these species, we present an updated list of species belonging to the R. sanguineus group, along with a review of their geographic distribution and vector role for various pathogens of animals and humans. We also identify knowledge gaps to be bridged in future studies.},

abstract = {Ticks obtain a blood meal by lacerating small blood vessels and ingesting the  blood that flows to the feeding site, which triggers various host responses. However, ticks face the challenge of wound healing, a process involving hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation and migration, and remodeling, hindering blood acquisition. To overcome these obstacles, tick salivary glands produce an array of bioactive molecules. Here, we characterize ixochymostatin, an Ixodes scapularis protein belonging to the trypsin inhibitor-like (TIL) family. It is expressed in multiple developmental stages and in tick salivary glands and acts as a slow and tight-binding inhibitor of chymase, cathepsin G, and chymotrypsin. Predictions for the tertiary structure complex between ixochymostatin and chymase suggest a direct interaction between the inhibitor reactive site loop and protease active sites. In vitro, ixochymostatin protects the endothelial cell barrier against chymase degrading action, decreasing cell permeability. In vivo, it reduces vascular permeability induced by chymase and compound 48/80, a mast cell degranulator agonist, in a mouse model. Additionally, ixochymostatin inhibits the chymase-dependent generation of vasoconstrictor peptides. Antibodies against ixochymostatin neutralize its inhibitory properties, with epitope mapping identifying potential neutralization regions. Ixochymostatin emerges as a novel tick protein modulating host responses against tick feeding, facilitating blood acquisition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Female ticks remain attached to their host for multiple days to  complete a blood meal. This prolonged feeding period is accompanied by a significant increase in the tick's size and body weight, paralleled by noteworthy changes to the tick midgut. While the midgut is recognized for its established role in blood storage and processing, its importance extends to playing a crucial role in the acquisition, survival, and proliferation of pathogens. Despite this, our overall understanding of tick midgut biology is limited. RESULTS: Our transcriptome analysis identified 15,599 putative DNA coding sequences (CDS), which were classified into 26 functional groups. Dimensional and differential expression analyses revealed four primary transcriptional profiles corresponding to unfed, slow-feeding, transitory (from slow- to rapid-feeding), and rapid-feeding stages. Additionally, comparing the current dataset with previously deposited transcriptome from other tick species allowed the identification of commonly expressed transcripts across different feeding stages. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a detailed temporal resolution of numerous metabolic pathways in the midgut of A. americanum adult females throughout the feeding process, highlighting the dynamic transcriptional regulation of the tick's midgut as feeding progresses. Furthermore, we identified conserved transcripts across three different tick species that exhibit similar expression patterns. This knowledge not only enhances our understanding of the physiological processes within the tick midgut but also opens up potential avenues for developing control methods that target multiple tick species.},

The municipality of Sobral, in the state of Cear{\'{a}}, is a historical focus of visceral leishmaniasis in both humans and dogs, but data on Leishmania spp. infections in cats are limited. Between April 2021 and February 2022, 205 cats from a referral hospital population were sampled and tested for Leishmania spp. by real-time PCR. Eight cats (3.9%; 95% CI: 1.7-7.5%) tested positive. Among these, three (37.5%) displayed clinical signs compatible with feline leishmaniosis. Non-domiciled cats showed significantly higher positivity compared to domiciled ones (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0124). Considering their potential role as reservoirs of L. infantum, it is crucial to conduct further studies to understand the Leishmania spp. circulating among cats in Sobral and to implement measures for reducing their exposure to phlebotomine sand fly vectors in this important focus of leishmaniases.},

abstract = {Blood-feeding behavior has independently evolved in arthropods multiple times.  Unlike hard ticks, soft ticks employ a rapid-feeding strategy for hematophagy, and there are comparatively limited studies on the transcriptomes of these organisms. This study investigates the soft tick Ornithodoros hermsi, conducting histopathological examinations at bitten skin sites and tick whole-body transcriptomic analyses across various developmental and feeding stages, including larvae, 1st-nymphal, and 2nd-nymphal stages. The results revealed the ability of O. hermsi to induce skin hemorrhage at the bite sites. Transcriptomic analyses identified three consistent transcriptional profiles: unfed, early-fed (6 h, 12 h, 24 h), and late-fed (5 days). The unfed profile exhibited high transcriptional activity across most of the functional classes annotated. In contrast, early-fed stages exhibited decreased expression of most functional classes, except for the unknown, which is highly expressed. Finally, transcriptional expression of most functional classes increased in the late-fed groups, resembling the baseline expression observed in the unfed groups. These findings highlight intense pre-feeding transcriptional activity in O. hermsi ticks, aligning with their rapid-feeding strategy. Moreover, besides shedding light on the temporal dynamics of key pathways during blood meal processing and tick development, this study contributes significantly to the transcriptome repertoire of a medically relevant soft tick species with relatively limited prior knowledge.},

O. hermsi is nidicolous and primarily inhabits nest cavities and burrows of small rodents and birds, with chipmunks and tree squirrels serving as its primary hosts. When no hosts are available, they can fast for several years. O. hermsi is found in restricted habitats where their hosts live in coniferous pine and Douglass fir forests at elevations of 1,500–10,000 feet in western North America. Rustic forest cabins infested with rodents and O. hermsi are the primary exposure sites for humans, who may be bitten while sleeping by these nocturnally active ticks. O. hermsi bites cause erythema and local discomfort, but compared to other species, effects appear benign. Other bite effects like toxicosis and paralysis remain unknown.},

Serum and tick samples were collected from dogs, terrestrial small mammals, and humans. Ticks were also collected from the environment. Dogs were infested with Rhipicephalus linnaei adults, whereas small mammals were infested by immature stages of Amblyomma spp., Amblyomma triste, Amblyomma dubitatum, and Amblyomma coelebs. Ticks collected from vegetation belonged to several species of the genus Amblyomma, including A. coelebs, A. dubitatum, Amblyomma naponense, Amblyomma sculptum, and A. triste. Two Rickettsia species were molecularly detected in ticks: Rickettsia parkeri in A. triste from the vegetation and a Rickettsia sp. (designated Rickettsia sp. strain PNE) in A. sculptum and A. triste collected from lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris). Based on short gltA gene fragments, this rickettsial organism showed 99.7-100% to Rickettsia tillamookensis. Seroreactivity to Rickettsia antigens was detected in 21.9% of dogs, 15.4% of small mammals, and 23.5% of humans. The present study reveals the richness of ticks and demonstrates the circulation of rickettsial agents in one of the largest conservation units in the Cerrado biome in Brazil.

For this purpose, a randomized and controlled clinical trial was conducted between August 2021 and October 2022, in the municipality of Goiana, state of Pernambuco, north-eastern Brazil, where heartworm is highly prevalent. Of the 213 dogs initially sampled (baseline), 68 (31.9%) were positive for adult antigens (SNAP 4Dx Plus, Idexx) and/or microfilariae (modified Knott's test). On day 0, 140 negative dogs were randomly included in the treatment and control groups, 70 animals each. During the study, 60 dogs (34 treated and 26 untreated) were removed for different reasons. At the end of the study (day 360 ± 2), 36 treated and 44 untreated were sampled and included in the efficacy calculation. The efficacy against the development of adults and microfilariae was 84.7%, with only one treated dog being positive for adult antigens but negative for microfilariae. On the other hand, eight untreated dogs were positive for adult antigens and/or microfilariae, resulting in a significant difference in the number of positives between groups (Chi-square test = 4.706, df = 1, P = 0.0301). Remarkably, the efficacy against the appearance of D. immitis microfilariae was 100% (i.e., all treated dogs negative) and three untreated dogs were positive for microfilariae. The topical combination of moxidectin 3.5%, imidacloprid 10% and praziquantel 10% significantly reduced the risk of D. immitis infection in treated dogs as compared with untreated dogs, in a highly endemic area in north-eastern Brazil.},

In the present study, we evaluated both the population dynamics of A. cajennense s.s. in a degraded area of the Amazon biome and the presence of rickettsial organisms in this tick population. METHODS: The study was carried out in a rural area of the Santa In{\^{e}}s municipality (altitude: 24 m a.s.l.), Maranh{\~{a}}o state, Brazil. Ticks were collected from the environment for 24 consecutive months, from June 2021 to May 2023. The region is characterized by two warm seasons: a rainy season (November-May) and a dry season (June-October). We characterized the temporal activity of A. cajennense s.s. on the vegetation by examining questing activity for each life stage (larvae, nymphs, adults [males and females]) in relation to the dry and rainy season. Ticks collected in this study were randomly selected and individually tested by a TaqMan real-time PCR assay that targeted a 147-bp fragment of the rickettsial gltA gene. RESULTS: Overall, 1843 (62.4%) adults (52.6% females, 47.4% males), 1110 (37.6%) nymphs and 398 larval clusters were collected. All adult females and nymphs were morphologically identified as A. cajennense s.s. Larval activity was observed from April to December, with a peak from June to September (dry season); nymph abundance peaked from September to November (transition period between dry and rainy seasons); and adult ticks were abundant from October to May (spring/summer/early autumn). The infection rate by R. amblyommatis in A. cajennense s.s. ticks was at least 7% (7/99). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a 1-year generation pattern for A. cajennense s.s., with a well-defined seasonality of larvae, nymphs and adults in the Amazon biome. Larvae predominate during the dry season, nymphs are most abundant in the dry-rainy season transition and adults are most abundant in the rainy season. The presence of R. amblyommatis in adult ticks suggests that animals and humans in the study region are at risk of infection by this species belonging to the spotted fever group of Rickettsia.},

Blood samples collected from 23 capybaras were used to investigate the presence of piroplasmids and Ehrlichia spp. in stained-blood smears and by PCR.

A total of 955 ticks were collected, including 822 (86.1%) Amblyomma sculptum, 132 (13.8%) Amblyomma dubitatum, and one (0.1%) unidentified larva of Amblyomma sp. Neither the capybaras nor ticks were positive for Ehrlichia spp. However, a stained-blood smear examination revealed the presence of ring-stage and pyriform-shaped merozoites in the erythrocytes of one (4.4%) capybara.

In this study, we assessed the presence of CVBPs in an Afro-descendent community (Quilombola) of northeastern, Brazil. Dog blood samples (n = 201) were collected and analyzed by rapid test for the detection of antibodies against Leishmania spp., Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), and antigens of Dirofilaria immitis. In addition, polymerase chain reactions were performed for Anaplasmataceae, Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Rickettsia spp. and B. burgdorferi s.l. Overall, 66.7% of the dogs scored positive to at least one pathogen at serological and/or molecular methods. Antibodies against Ehrlichia spp. were the most frequently detected (57.2%; n = 115/201), followed by Anaplasma spp. (8.5%; n = 17/201), Leishmania spp. (8.5%; n = 17/201) and B. burgdorferi s.l.

All samples were negative for B. burgdorferi s.l. Our data demonstrated the presence of CVBPs in the studied population, with a high seropositivity for Ehrlichia spp. In addition, considering the detection of zoonotic pathogens in dogs and their relationship with people from Quilombola communities, effective control strategies are advocated for minimizing the risk of infection in this socially vulnerable human population and their pets.},

In this paper, we report the finding of an argasid species resembling O. mimon, which similarly may be found in human dwellings and parasitize humans in Brazil. We also provide molecular evidence that this argasid tick species may carry a rickettsial organism, whose pathogenicity remains unknown. A total of 16 ticks (two females, two males and 12 nymphs) were collected in the bedroom and in the attic of a human house, where cases of "insect" bites have been recurrent. These ticks were identified morphologically and genetically as Ornithodoros cf. mimon. Upon PCR testing, four of these ticks (one female and three nymphs) were positive for human blood and for a bacterium closely related to "Candidatus Rickettsia paranaensis". In conclusion, we report for the first time in Brazil an argasid tick species morphologically and genetically related to O. mimon, which feeds on humans and carry a rickettsial organism belonging to the spotted fever group.

abstract = {Proinflammatory cytokine secretion determines the infection course in  leishmaniasis. The immunopathology of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum is characterized by low Leishmania-specific IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-17 production. Mutations in the human IL-17 gene promoter alter cytokine expression and may increase the susceptibility of humans to some infectious diseases. In this study, we correlated canine IL-17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with anti-Leishmania IgG levels, parasite load and external clinical signs in dogs naturally exposed to L. infantum in Brazil. A higher frequency (Chi-square test: X(2)= 5.378, df= 1, P= 0.020) of major alleles was observed among dogs showing no external clinical signs attributable to Leishmania infection. A high proportion of A allele carriers (mutant) were observed among dogs with high antibody levels, although differences were not statistically significant (Chi-square test: X(2)= 4.410, df= 4, P= 0.353), as compared to dogs with low antibody levels. In general, the association of canine IL-17 SNPs with disease expression or disease exasperation did not reach enough statistical power to allow the use of these mutations as prognostic markers. This knowledge may pave the way for further investigations on the genetic aspects of CanL and its immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Reptiles and amphibians are exceptional hosts for different ectoparasites,  including mites and ticks. In this study, we investigated tick infestations on reptiles and amphibians trapped in Central Amazonia, and also assessed the presence of rickettsial infections in the collected ticks. From September 2016 to September 2019, 385 reptiles (350 lizards, 20 snakes, 12 tortoises, and three caimans) and 120 amphibians (119 anurans and one caecilian) were captured and examined for ectoparasites. Overall, 35 (10%) lizards, three (25%) tortoises and one (0.8%) toad were parasitized by ticks (124 larvae, 32 nymphs, and 22 adults). In lizards, tick infestation varied significantly according to landscape category and age group. Based on combined morphological and molecular analyses, these ticks were identified as Amblyomma humerale (14 larvae, 12 nymphs, 19 males, and one female), Amblyomma nodosum (three larvae, one nymph, and one female), and Amblyomma rotundatum (four larvae, three nymphs, and one female), and Amblyomma spp. (103 larvae and 16 nymphs). Our study presents the first records of A. nodosum in the Amazonas state and suggests that teiid lizards are important hosts for larvae and nymphs of A. humerale in Central Amazonia. Moreover, a nymph of A. humerale collected from a common tegu (Tupinambis teguixin) was found positive for Rickettsia amblyommatis, which agrees with previous reports, suggesting that the A. humerale-R. amblyommatis relationship may be more common than currently recognized.},

In this study, we investigated tick infestations on birds trapped in an urban remnant of Atlantic Forest in Pernambuco state, Brazil. From February 2015 to March 2017, 541 birds belonging to 52 species were trapped with mist nets and examined for ectoparasites. Birds trapped in the late successional forest were significantly more infested than birds trapped in the early successional forest. In the same way, ectoparasite infestation varied significantly according to bird weight and collection plot. Overall, 198 birds (36.6%) belonging to 27 species were parasitized by ectoparasites (i.e., ticks, lice and/or mites). Ectoparasites were effectively collected from 111 birds, of which 99 belonging to 20 species were infested by ticks (n = 261), namely, Amblyomma longirostre (13 nymphs), Amblyomma nodosum (21 nymphs), Amblyomma varium (one nymph), and Amblyomma spp. (five nymphs and 221 larvae). Most of the ticks (> 90%) were collected from Passeriformes. This study provides the second record of A. varium in Pernambuco state and confirms that birds, especially Passeriformes, are important hosts for larvae and nymphs of Amblyomma spp. in the Atlantic Forest biome of Pernambuco.},

abstract = {Lutzomyia longipalpis sensu lato is a complex of phlebotomine sand fly species,  which are widespread in the Neotropics. They have a great medico-veterinary importance due their role as vectors of Leishmania infantum, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. Morphological variations of Lu. longipalpis s.l. males were reported in the late 1960s in Brazil. Male populations can present either one pair of spots on third abdominal tergites or two pairs on third and fourth ones, namely 1S and 2S phenotypes, respectively. Since then, there has been much interest on the taxonomic status of Lu. longipalpis s.l. Thereafter, several lines of evidence have been congruent in suggesting the existence of an uncertain number of cryptic species within Lu. longipalpis s.l. in Brazil. Herein, a 525 bp-fragment of the period gene was used for assessing the genetic structure and phylogenetic relationship of Lu. longipalpis s.l. populations in Brazil. We performed two set of analyses, first we originally sequenced three populations (Passira, Santar{\'{e}}m and Teresina) of Lu. longipalpis s.l. and compared them. Thereafter, we performed a global analysis including in our dataset other three pairs of sympatric populations of Lu. longipalpis s.l. from three Brazilian localities available in GenBank. Fixed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) sharing, maximum likelihood inference, genetic structure and haplotype analyses revealed the presence of two genetic groups, one composed of Teresina population, and the other encompassing Passira and Santar{\'{e}}m populations. The global analysis reflected the first of its kind, and two prominent groups were observed: the clade I comprising Teresina 1S, Bodoc{\'{o}} 1S, Cariria{\c{c}}u 1S and Sobral 1S; and the clade II encompassing Passira 2S, Santar{\'{e}}m 1S, Bodoc{\'{o}} 2S, Cariria{\c{c}}u 2S and Sobral 2S. Genetic differentiation data suggested a limited gene flow between populations of the clade I versus clade II. Our results disclosed the presence of two prominent genetic groups, which could reasonably represent populations of Lu. longipalpis s.l. whose males produce the same courtship song.},

abstract = {Babesial parasites are some of the most ubiquitous blood pathogens and  consequently have considerable worldwide veterinary impact. Dogs living in the tropics are highly exposed to babesial parasites, particularly to Babesia vogeli. Limited data on the seroprevalence and molecular prevalence of Babesia spp. in dogs are available in Latin America. We conducted a cross-sectional study combining serological and molecular tests to estimate the seroprevalence and molecular epidemiology of Babesia spp. infections in dogs in two hyperendemic foci in Brazil. A total of 630 privately owned dogs (417 from Goiana municipality, Pernambuco state, north-eastern Brazil, and 213 from S{\~{a}}o Joaquim de Bicas municipality, Minas Gerais state, south-eastern Brazil) were sampled and molecularly and serologically tested for Babesia spp. Overall, 519 dogs (82.4%) presented detectable IgG antibodies against Babesia spp., and seropositivity was significantly higher in dogs older than 1 year. Molecularly, 34 dogs (5.4%) were positive for a $\sim$ 200 bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia spp. and 88 (14.0%) for a longer fragment ($\sim$ 450 bp) of the same gene of Babesia spp. and other protozoa. The 18S rRNA gene sequences generated herein corresponded to B. vogeli (n = 52) or Hepatozoon canis (n = 20). This study confirms a high level of exposure to B. vogeli in two areas of Brazil and highlights that most of the dogs living in these areas are infected during the course of their life, reflected by increased seroprevalence in older dogs. Increased awareness and prevention of tick-borne protozoa infections in dogs from Brazil and Latin America are urgently needed.},

abstract = {The genus Amblyomma is the most representative tick genus in Brazil and some  species act as vectors of pathogenic organisms to animals and humans. Information on the seasonal dynamics of Amblyomma spp. as well as on rickettsial organisms infecting these ticks in some regions in Brazil is still fragmentary. Herein, we investigated the seasonal dynamics and rickettsial infections in Amblyomma dubitatum ticks collected in the Atlantic forest biome in north-eastern Brazil. Using carbon dioxide traps, ticks were collected monthly for two consecutive years. In total, 15,789 ticks were collected: 69 females (0.4%), 116 males (0.7%), 1,067 nymphs (6.8%), and 14,537 larvae (92.1%). All nymphs, females and males were identified as A. dubitatum, whereas larvae were identified as Amblyomma spp. Larvae were more frequent in summer (77% of the larvae collected), whereas nymphs were collected with similar frequency in summer (32.8%), autumn (30.0%) and spring (28.4%). Adults were more frequent in spring (47.6%). A total of 648 ticks (485 nymphs, 60 females, and 103 males) were tested by PCR for the gltA gene of Rickettsia spp. and 87 (13.4%; 95% CI: 10.9-16.3%) were positive. A consensus sequence (size, 350 bp) of 66 gltA gene sequences indicate that the organism detected herein is similar to Rickettsia tamurae, Rickettsia monacencis and Rickettsia sp. strain Pampulha. One of these positive samples was also positive for the ompA gene of spotted fever group rickettsiae, but attempts to sequence the amplicon were not successful. We also tested this sample by a PCR targeting the rickettsial htrA gene, but no amplification product could be detected. This study indicates that A. dubitatum may be a common tick in areas where capybaras are present in north-eastern Brazil, occurring during the whole year. It also suggests the circulation of a spotted fever group rickettsia in this A. dubitatum population, whose identity has yet to be determined.},

abstract = {A species complex (= species group, species series) is an assemblage of species,  which are related morphologically and phylogenetically. Recent research has revealed several arthropod vector species that were believed to be a single nominal species actually representing a group of closely related species, which are sometimes morphologically indistinguishable at one or more developmental stages. In some instances, differences in terms of vector competence, capacity, or both have been recorded. It highlights the importance of detecting and studying species complexes to improve our understanding of pathogen transmission patterns, which may be vectored more or less efficiently by different species within the complex. Considering more than 540 species, about one-third of the phlebotomine sand flies in the New World present males and/or females morphologically indistinguishable to one or more species. Remarkably, several of these species may act in transmission of pathogenic agents. In this article, we review recent research on species complexes in phlebotomine sand flies from the Americas. Possible practical implications of recently acquired knowledge and future research needs are also discussed.},

Data on the number of dogs screened during 2008-2017 (except 2010) were obtained from the Centre for Zoonoses Control of Sobral. The annual screening coverage during 2012-2017 was calculated. Data on human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases during 2008-2017 were compiled from the National Disease Notification System. Correlation analyses were performed to assess the correlation between canine and human data. During 2008-2017, 73,964 dogs (range, 0 to 13,980 dogs/year) were serologically screened and 2,833 (3.8%) were positive. The annual screening coverage during 2012-2017 ranged from 11.1% to 45.7%. There were no significant correlations between the number of dogs culled and the number of human VL cases, canine positivity and human VL incidence, number of dogs culled and human VL incidence, or between canine positivity and number of human VL cases. An inconsistent and relatively low annual screening coverage was found in the study area, with no dog being screened in 2010 due to the lack of serological tests. Our results highlight that many dogs potentially infected with Leishmania infantum have been virtually overlooked by public health workers in the study area, perhaps with a negative, yet underestimated, impact on the control of canine and human VL. Hence, the failure of the dog culling strategy in controlling human VL in Brazil may be due to the low screening coverage and low percentage of culled dogs, rather than the absence of associations between canine and human infections.},
