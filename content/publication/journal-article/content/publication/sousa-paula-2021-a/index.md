abstract: 'Lutzomyia longipalpis sensu lato is a complex of phlebotomine sand fly
  species,  which are widespread in the Neotropics. They have a great medico-veterinary
  importance due their role as vectors of Leishmania infantum, the causative agent
  of visceral leishmaniasis. Morphological variations of Lu. longipalpis s.l. males
  were reported in the late 1960s in Brazil. Male populations can present either one
  pair of spots on third abdominal tergites or two pairs on third and fourth ones,
  namely 1S and 2S phenotypes, respectively. Since then, there has been much interest
  on the taxonomic status of Lu. longipalpis s.l. Thereafter, several lines of evidence
  have been congruent in suggesting the existence of an uncertain number of cryptic
  species within Lu. longipalpis s.l. in Brazil. Herein, a 525 bp-fragment of the
  period gene was used for assessing the genetic structure and phylogenetic relationship
  of Lu. longipalpis s.l. populations in Brazil. We performed two set of analyses,
  first we originally sequenced three populations (Passira, Santarém and Teresina)
  of Lu. longipalpis s.l. and compared them. Thereafter, we performed a global analysis
  including in our dataset other three pairs of sympatric populations of Lu. longipalpis
  s.l. from three Brazilian localities available in GenBank. Fixed single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) sharing, maximum likelihood inference, genetic structure and
  haplotype analyses revealed the presence of two genetic groups, one composed of
  Teresina population, and the other encompassing Passira and Santarém populations.
  The global analysis reflected the first of its kind, and two prominent groups were
  observed: the clade I comprising Teresina 1S, Bodocó 1S, Caririaçu 1S and Sobral
  1S; and the clade II encompassing Passira 2S, Santarém 1S, Bodocó 2S, Caririaçu
  2S and Sobral 2S. Genetic differentiation data suggested a limited gene flow between
  populations of the clade I versus clade II. Our results disclosed the presence of
  two prominent genetic groups, which could reasonably represent populations of Lu.
  longipalpis s.l. whose males produce the same courtship song.'
