abstract: A species complex (= species group, species series) is an assemblage of
  species,  which are related morphologically and phylogenetically. Recent research
  has revealed several arthropod vector species that were believed to be a single
  nominal species actually representing a group of closely related species, which
  are sometimes morphologically indistinguishable at one or more developmental stages.
  In some instances, differences in terms of vector competence, capacity, or both
  have been recorded. It highlights the importance of detecting and studying species
  complexes to improve our understanding of pathogen transmission patterns, which
  may be vectored more or less efficiently by different species within the complex.
  Considering more than 540 species, about one-third of the phlebotomine sand flies
  in the New World present males and/or females morphologically indistinguishable
  to one or more species. Remarkably, several of these species may act in transmission
  of pathogenic agents. In this article, we review recent research on species complexes
  in phlebotomine sand flies from the Americas. Possible practical implications of
  recently acquired knowledge and future research needs are also discussed.
