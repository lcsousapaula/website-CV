abstract: Ornithodoros hermsi is a small, multi-host soft tick that feeds rapidly
  on blood  in all life stages, including larva, 2 to 5 nymphal instars (primarily
  3), and male and female. As adults, they can feed repeatedly and reproduce for many
  years. O. hermsi is nidicolous and primarily inhabits nest cavities and burrows
  of small rodents and birds, with chipmunks and tree squirrels serving as its primary
  hosts. When no hosts are available, they can fast for several years. O. hermsi is
  found in restricted habitats where their hosts live in coniferous pine and Douglass
  fir forests at elevations of 1,500â€“10,000 feet in western North America. Rustic
  forest cabins infested with rodents and O. hermsi are the primary exposure sites
  for humans, who may be bitten while sleeping by these nocturnally active ticks.
  O. hermsi bites cause erythema and local discomfort, but compared to other species,
  effects appear benign. Other bite effects like toxicosis and paralysis remain unknown.
