abstract: Birds are important hosts for various tick species, playing a significant
  role in  their biological life cycle and dispersion. In this study, we investigated
  tick infestations on birds trapped in an urban remnant of Atlantic Forest in Pernambuco
  state, Brazil. From February 2015 to March 2017, 541 birds belonging to 52 species
  were trapped with mist nets and examined for ectoparasites. Birds trapped in the
  late successional forest were significantly more infested than birds trapped in
  the early successional forest. In the same way, ectoparasite infestation varied
  significantly according to bird weight and collection plot. Overall, 198 birds (36.6%)
  belonging to 27 species were parasitized by ectoparasites (i.e., ticks, lice and/or
  mites). Ectoparasites were effectively collected from 111 birds, of which 99 belonging
  to 20 species were infested by ticks (n = 261), namely, Amblyomma longirostre (13
  nymphs), Amblyomma nodosum (21 nymphs), Amblyomma varium (one nymph), and Amblyomma
  spp. (five nymphs and 221 larvae). Most of the ticks (> 90%) were collected from
  Passeriformes. This study provides the second record of A. varium in Pernambuco
  state and confirms that birds, especially Passeriformes, are important hosts for
  larvae and nymphs of Amblyomma spp. in the Atlantic Forest biome of Pernambuco.
