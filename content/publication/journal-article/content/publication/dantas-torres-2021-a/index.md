abstract: Babesial parasites are some of the most ubiquitous blood pathogens and  consequently
  have considerable worldwide veterinary impact. Dogs living in the tropics are highly
  exposed to babesial parasites, particularly to Babesia vogeli. Limited data on the
  seroprevalence and molecular prevalence of Babesia spp. in dogs are available in
  Latin America. We conducted a cross-sectional study combining serological and molecular
  tests to estimate the seroprevalence and molecular epidemiology of Babesia spp.
  infections in dogs in two hyperendemic foci in Brazil. A total of 630 privately
  owned dogs (417 from Goiana municipality, Pernambuco state, north-eastern Brazil,
  and 213 from São Joaquim de Bicas municipality, Minas Gerais state, south-eastern
  Brazil) were sampled and molecularly and serologically tested for Babesia spp. Overall,
  519 dogs (82.4%) presented detectable IgG antibodies against Babesia spp., and seropositivity
  was significantly higher in dogs older than 1 year. Molecularly, 34 dogs (5.4%)
  were positive for a $∼$ 200 bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia spp. and
  88 (14.0%) for a longer fragment ($∼$ 450 bp) of the same gene of Babesia spp. and
  other protozoa. The 18S rRNA gene sequences generated herein corresponded to B.
  vogeli (n = 52) or Hepatozoon canis (n = 20). This study confirms a high level of
  exposure to B. vogeli in two areas of Brazil and highlights that most of the dogs
  living in these areas are infected during the course of their life, reflected by
  increased seroprevalence in older dogs. Increased awareness and prevention of tick-borne
  protozoa infections in dogs from Brazil and Latin America are urgently needed.
