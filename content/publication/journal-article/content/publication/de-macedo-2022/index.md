abstract: Canine vector-borne pathogens (CVBPs) comprise a group of disease agents
  mainly  transmitted by ticks, fleas, mosquitoes and sand flies. In this study, we
  assessed the presence of CVBPs in an Afro-descendent community (Quilombola) of northeastern,
  Brazil. Dog blood samples (n = 201) were collected and analyzed by rapid test for
  the detection of antibodies against Leishmania spp., Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp.
  and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), and antigens of Dirofilaria immitis.
  In addition, polymerase chain reactions were performed for Anaplasmataceae, Babesia
  spp., Hepatozoon spp., Rickettsia spp. and B. burgdorferi s.l. Overall, 66.7% of
  the dogs scored positive to at least one pathogen at serological and/or molecular
  methods. Antibodies against Ehrlichia spp. were the most frequently detected (57.2%;
  n = 115/201), followed by Anaplasma spp. (8.5%; n = 17/201), Leishmania spp. (8.5%;
  n = 17/201) and B. burgdorferi s.l. (0.5%; n = 1/201). For D. immitis, 11 out of
  201 (5.5%) animals scored positive. At the molecular analysis, 10.4% (n = 21/201)
  of the samples scored positive for Babesia spp./Hepatozoon spp., followed by Anaplasmataceae
  (5.0%; n = 10/201) and Rickettsia spp. (3.0%; n = 6/201). All samples were negative
  for B. burgdorferi s.l. Our data demonstrated the presence of CVBPs in the studied
  population, with a high seropositivity for Ehrlichia spp. In addition, considering
  the detection of zoonotic pathogens in dogs and their relationship with people from
  Quilombola communities, effective control strategies are advocated for minimizing
  the risk of infection in this socially vulnerable human population and their pets.
