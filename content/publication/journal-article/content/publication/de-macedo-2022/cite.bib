 abstract = {Canine vector-borne pathogens (CVBPs) comprise a group of disease agents mainly  transmitted by ticks, fleas, mosquitoes and sand flies. In this study, we assessed the presence of CVBPs in an Afro-descendent community (Quilombola) of northeastern, Brazil. Dog blood samples (n = 201) were collected and analyzed by rapid test for the detection of antibodies against Leishmania spp., Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), and antigens of Dirofilaria immitis. In addition, polymerase chain reactions were performed for Anaplasmataceae, Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Rickettsia spp. and B. burgdorferi s.l. Overall, 66.7% of the dogs scored positive to at least one pathogen at serological and/or molecular methods. Antibodies against Ehrlichia spp. were the most frequently detected (57.2%; n = 115/201), followed by Anaplasma spp. (8.5%; n = 17/201), Leishmania spp. (8.5%; n = 17/201) and B. burgdorferi s.l. (0.5%; n = 1/201). For D. immitis, 11 out of 201 (5.5%) animals scored positive. At the molecular analysis, 10.4% (n = 21/201) of the samples scored positive for Babesia spp./Hepatozoon spp., followed by Anaplasmataceae (5.0%; n = 10/201) and Rickettsia spp. (3.0%; n = 6/201). All samples were negative for B. burgdorferi s.l. Our data demonstrated the presence of CVBPs in the studied population, with a high seropositivity for Ehrlichia spp. In addition, considering the detection of zoonotic pathogens in dogs and their relationship with people from Quilombola communities, effective control strategies are advocated for minimizing the risk of infection in this socially vulnerable human population and their pets.},
