abstract: Colletotrichum musae is an important cosmopolitan pathogenic fungus that
  causes  anthracnose in banana fruit. The entire genome of C. musae isolate GM20
  (CMM 4420), originally isolated from infected banana fruit from Alagoas State, Brazil,
  was sequenced and annotated. The pathogen genomic DNA was sequenced on HiSeq Illumina
  platform. The C. musae GM20 genome has 50,635,197 bp with G + C content of 53.74%
  and in its present assembly has 2763 scaffolds, harboring 13,451 putative genes
  with an average length of 1626 bp. Gene prediction and annotation was performed
  by Funannotate pipeline, using a pattern for gene identification based on BUSCO.
