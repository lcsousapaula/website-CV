abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a topical combination
  of  moxidectin 3.5%, imidacloprid 10% and praziquantel 10% for the prevention of
  Dirofilaria immitis (Leidy, 1856) infection in dogs. For this purpose, a randomized
  and controlled clinical trial was conducted between August 2021 and October 2022,
  in the municipality of Goiana, state of Pernambuco, north-eastern Brazil, where
  heartworm is highly prevalent. Of the 213 dogs initially sampled (baseline), 68
  (31.9%) were positive for adult antigens (SNAP 4Dx Plus, Idexx) and/or microfilariae
  (modified Knott's test). On day 0, 140 negative dogs were randomly included in the
  treatment and control groups, 70 animals each. During the study, 60 dogs (34 treated
  and 26 untreated) were removed for different reasons. At the end of the study (day
  360 ± 2), 36 treated and 44 untreated were sampled and included in the efficacy
  calculation. The efficacy against the development of adults and microfilariae was
  84.7%, with only one treated dog being positive for adult antigens but negative
  for microfilariae. On the other hand, eight untreated dogs were positive for adult antigens
  and/or microfilariae, resulting in a significant difference in the number of positives
  between groups (Chi-square test = 4.706, df = 1, P = 0.0301). Remarkably, the efficacy
  against the appearance of D. immitis microfilariae was 100% (i.e., all treated dogs
  negative) and three untreated dogs were positive for microfilariae. The topical
  combination of moxidectin 3.5%, imidacloprid 10% and praziquantel 10% significantly
  reduced the risk of D. immitis infection in treated dogs as compared with untreated
  dogs, in a highly endemic area in north-eastern Brazil.
