abstract: The Rhipicephalus sanguineus group is an assembly of species morphologically
  and  phylogenetically related to Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu stricto. The taxonomy
  and systematics of this species group have remained obscure for a long time, but
  extensive research conducted during the past two decades has closed many knowledge
  gaps. These research advancements culminated in the redescription of R. sanguineus
  sensu stricto, with subsequent revalidation of former synonyms (Rhipicephalus linnaei,
  Rhipicephalus rutilus, and Rhipicephalus secundus) and even the description of new
  species (Rhipicephalus afranicus and Rhipicephalus hibericus). With a much clearer
  picture of the taxonomy of these species, we present an updated list of species
  belonging to the R. sanguineus group, along with a review of their geographic distribution
  and vector role for various pathogens of animals and humans. We also identify knowledge
  gaps to be bridged in future studies.
