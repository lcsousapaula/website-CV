abstract: 'Proinflammatory cytokine secretion determines the infection course in  leishmaniasis.
  The immunopathology of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum
  is characterized by low Leishmania-specific IFN-$γ$ and IL-17 production. Mutations
  in the human IL-17 gene promoter alter cytokine expression and may increase the
  susceptibility of humans to some infectious diseases. In this study, we correlated
  canine IL-17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with anti-Leishmania IgG levels,
  parasite load and external clinical signs in dogs naturally exposed to L. infantum
  in Brazil. A higher frequency (Chi-square test: X(2)= 5.378, df= 1, P= 0.020) of
  major alleles was observed among dogs showing no external clinical signs attributable
  to Leishmania infection. A high proportion of A allele carriers (mutant) were observed
  among dogs with high antibody levels, although differences were not statistically
  significant (Chi-square test: X(2)= 4.410, df= 4, P= 0.353), as compared to dogs
  with low antibody levels. In general, the association of canine IL-17 SNPs with
  disease expression or disease exasperation did not reach enough statistical power
  to allow the use of these mutations as prognostic markers. This knowledge may pave
  the way for further investigations on the genetic aspects of CanL and its immunotherapy.'
