 abstract = {Proinflammatory cytokine secretion determines the infection course in  leishmaniasis. The immunopathology of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum is characterized by low Leishmania-specific IFN-$γ$ and IL-17 production. Mutations in the human IL-17 gene promoter alter cytokine expression and may increase the susceptibility of humans to some infectious diseases. In this study, we correlated canine IL-17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with anti-Leishmania IgG levels, parasite load and external clinical signs in dogs naturally exposed to L. infantum in Brazil. A higher frequency (Chi-square test: X(2)= 5.378, df= 1, P= 0.020) of major alleles was observed among dogs showing no external clinical signs attributable to Leishmania infection. A high proportion of A allele carriers (mutant) were observed among dogs with high antibody levels, although differences were not statistically significant (Chi-square test: X(2)= 4.410, df= 4, P= 0.353), as compared to dogs with low antibody levels. In general, the association of canine IL-17 SNPs with disease expression or disease exasperation did not reach enough statistical power to allow the use of these mutations as prognostic markers. This knowledge may pave the way for further investigations on the genetic aspects of CanL and its immunotherapy.},
