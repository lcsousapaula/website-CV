abstract: Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are the largest rodents on Earth.
  While  capybaras are hosts for various tick species, there is limited information
  regarding the tick-borne pathogens they can carry. We investigated the presence
  of piroplasmids and Ehrlichia spp. in capybaras and their associated ticks in two
  peri-urban areas in Goiás state, central-western Brazil. Blood samples collected
  from 23 capybaras were used to investigate the presence of piroplasmids and Ehrlichia
  spp. in stained-blood smears and by PCR. Ticks collected from the capybaras were
  identified morphologically and also tested using PCR for the same pathogens. A total
  of 955 ticks were collected, including 822 (86.1%) Amblyomma sculptum, 132 (13.8%)
  Amblyomma dubitatum, and one (0.1%) unidentified larva of Amblyomma sp. Neither
  the capybaras nor ticks were positive for Ehrlichia spp. However, a stained-blood
  smear examination revealed the presence of ring-stage and pyriform-shaped merozoites
  in the erythrocytes of one (4.4%) capybara. In the same way, 47.8% (11/23) and 19.9%
  (36/181) of blood samples and ticks, respectively, were positive for piroplasmids
  in the PCR. We successfully sequenced a partial 18S rRNA gene fragment of four samples
  (two capybaras, one A. sculptum, and one A. dubitatum), and the phylogenetic reconstruction
  disclosed that the organism reported in the present study clusters within the genus
  Babesia. Further research is required for a formal delineation of this species (designated
  as Babesia sp. strain Capybara) and to investigate the hypothesis of A. dubitatum
  and A. sculptum ticks being vectors.
