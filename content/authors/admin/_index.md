## About Me

Lucas C. de Sousa-Paula is a biologist with a Master of Science degree in Biological Sciences and
a Doctor of Science degree (equivalent to a PhD) in Science. During his MSc and PhD courses in
Brazil, he focused his research on phlebotomine sand flies and leishmanial parasites, with a
background in population genetics, evolution, and bioinformatics. Additionally, Dr. Sousa-Paula
collaborated on studies about other arthropod vectors (such as ticks) and pathogens (including
Rickettsia spp. bacteria and Babesia spp. parasites), which helped to broaden his research interests
to other vectors, parasites, and diseases. Currently, he is a Visiting Fellow Postdoc at the Rocky
Mountain Laboratories (NIAID/NIH) in Hamilton, MT, USA, where he is receiving training in vector
biology, with a focus on tick vector species and their genomic and transcriptomic aspects.
