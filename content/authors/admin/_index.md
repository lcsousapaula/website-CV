      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Lucas C. de Sousa-Paula is a biologist with a Master of Science degree in Biological Sciences and
a Doctor of Science degree (equivalent to a PhD) in Science. During his MSc and PhD courses in
Brazil, he focused his research on phlebotomine sand flies and leishmanial parasites, with a
background in population genetics, evolution, and bioinformatics. Additionally, Dr. Sousa-Paula
collaborated on studies about other arthropod vectors (such as ticks) and pathogens (including
Rickettsia spp. bacteria and Babesia spp. parasites), which helped to broaden his research interests
to other vectors, parasites, and diseases. Currently, he is a Visiting Fellow Postdoc at the Rocky
Mountain Laboratories (NIAID/NIH) in Hamilton, MT, USA, where he is receiving training in vector
biology, with a focus on tick vector species and their genomic and transcriptomic aspects.
